Currently interested in data science and machine learning, I am a recent graduate from [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com). I have a lot of experience in particular with deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

Previously, I got my PhD in mathematics at the University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of [Dr. Michel Lapidus](http://math.ucr.edu/~lapidus/) in the [fractal research group](http://www.math.ucr.edu/~frgmpds/). My thesis was on a mix of fractal geometry, differential equations, and noncommutative geometry. Before that, I studied mathematics and physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

My resume is available [here](/assets/Resume.pdf). I have personal projects kind of split all over the place.

* Many data science competitions I've competed in, as well as smaller projects, can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/frankkloster).
* I have a bunch of stuff on [Github](https://github.com/frankkloster).

When I'm not working, I like to read, hike, and take pictures.
