In a previous life, I studied mathematics and physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and then obtained my Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of California, Riverside. My thesis was on a mix of fractal geometry, differential equations, and noncommutative geometry.

During my last few years, I developed a side interest in data science and machine learning. In my final year, I took a fellowship at the Data Incubator. In particular, I've developed a lot of experience in deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

When I'm not working, I like to read, hike, and take pictures.

For anyone curious, I have personal projects kind of split all over the place.

* I have several different manner of data science-related projects on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/frankkloster).
* I have several more generic programming projects on [Github](https://github.com/frankkloster).
